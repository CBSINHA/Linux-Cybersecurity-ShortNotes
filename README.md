- Python: `with open('filename.txt', 'mode') as file_object:` recommended and safest way to handle file operations as it **closes the file automatically** after use
- Bash: `mv original_filename {,_extended_filename}` results in the **final filename** as *`original_filename_extended_filename`*
- Python: Simply converting a file with numbers(string format) to actually int numbers
